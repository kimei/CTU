Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all internal clocks in this design. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high". For a balance between the fastest runtime and best performance, set the effort level to "med".</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>WARNING Timing:3232 - Timing Constraint
