      Number using O5 output only:              19
      Number using O5 and O6:                   27
    Number used as Memory:                      12 out of   6,080    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:            12
        Number using O6 output only:            12
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         4
  Number of route-thrus:                        25 out of  40,960    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                22
    Number using O5 output only:                 2
    Number using O5 and O6:                      1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   180 out of   5,120    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          425
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           101 out of     425   23%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 146 out of     425   34%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         178 out of     425   41%
    Number of unique control sets:              35
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              76 out of  20,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        72 out of     360   20%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             21

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       2 out of      68    2%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  2
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                     72 out of   2,448    2%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      7 out of      32   21%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        7
  Number of PLL_ADVs:                            1 out of       2   50%
  Number of TEMACs:                              1 out of       2   50%

Peak Memory Usage:  323 MB
