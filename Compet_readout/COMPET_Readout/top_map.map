ERROR:Pack:2655 - This design is too large to fit in the target device due to 
   control set restrictions.
   There are 2033 unique register control sets in this design and
   due to their loading, 7636 slices are required to fit the design
   but only 7200 slices are available.To get a detailed report of the control
   sets in your design,
   please run MAP with the Generate Detailed MAP Report (-detail) option.
ERROR:Map:115 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

   NOTE:  An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

Interim Summary

Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                26,739 out of  28,800   92%
    Number used as Flip Flops:              26,611
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                128
  Number of Slice LUTs:                     21,060 out of  28,800   73%
    Number used as logic:                   17,052 out of  28,800   59%

      Number using O5 output only:           1,716
      Number using O5 and O6:                4,113
    Number used as Memory:                   3,732 out of   7,680   48%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:          3,072
        Number using O6 output only:           512
        Number using O5 and O6:              2,560
      Number used as Shift Register:           660
        Number using O6 output only:           660
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:       276
  Number of route-thrus:                     1,993 out of  57,600    3%
    Number using O6 output only:             1,992
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       35,582
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         8,843 out of  35,582   24%
    Number with an unused LUT:              14,522 out of  35,582   40%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      12,217 out of  35,582   34%
    Number of unique control sets:           2,162
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           3,809 out of  28,800   13%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        84 out of     480   17%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             23
    IOB Master Pads:                             1
    IOB Slave Pads:                              1

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       4 out of      60    6%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  4
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               1
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               6
    Total Memory used (KB):                    144 out of   2,160    6%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                     17 out of      32   53%
