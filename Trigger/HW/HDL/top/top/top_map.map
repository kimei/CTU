Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    4
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    63 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  63
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        116 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                      114 out of  20,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              86
      Number using O5 output only:              26
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        28 out of  40,960    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                28

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    42 out of   5,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          121
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            58 out of     121   47%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of     121    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          58 out of     121   47%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              13 out of  20,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        10 out of     360    2%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              1
    IOB Master Pads:                             2
    IOB Slave Pads:                              2

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3
  Number of PLL_ADVs:                            1 out of       2   50%
