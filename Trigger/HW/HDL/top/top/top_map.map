  Number of Slice Registers:                    86 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  86
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        137 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                      135 out of  20,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             106
      Number using O5 output only:              26
      Number using O5 and O6:                    3
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        28
    Number using O6 output only:                28

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    55 out of   5,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          152
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            66 out of     152   43%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  15 out of     152    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          71 out of     152   46%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              18 out of  20,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
