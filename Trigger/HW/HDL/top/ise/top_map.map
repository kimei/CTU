Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    36 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  36
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         72 out of  20,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                       71 out of  20,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              56
      Number using O5 output only:              14
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        15
    Number using O6 output only:                15

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    25 out of   5,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           74
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            38 out of      74   51%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of      74    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          34 out of      74   45%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               4 out of  20,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         5 out of     360    1%
