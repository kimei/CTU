      Number using O6 output only:             173
      Number using O5 output only:              33
      Number using O5 and O6:                   14
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of   6,080    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         3
  Number of route-thrus:                        37 out of  40,960    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                36
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   128 out of   5,120    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          283
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           100 out of     283   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  59 out of     283   20%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         124 out of     283   43%
    Number of unique control sets:              24
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              48 out of  20,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        87 out of     360   24%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             23
    IOB Master Pads:                             5
    IOB Slave Pads:                              5

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       1 out of      68    1%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               2
    Total Memory used (KB):                     36 out of   2,448    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                     10 out of      32   31%
    Number used as BUFGs:                       10
  Number of PLL_ADVs:                            1 out of       2   50%
  Number of TEMACs:                              1 out of       2   50%
