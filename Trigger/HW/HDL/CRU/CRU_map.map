Mapping design into LUTs...

Running delay-based LUT packing...
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
Running timing-driven packing...

Phase 1.1
ERROR:Place:910 - It appears that the specified pin locations for differential
   pair "mclk" (LOC="AB15") and "mclk_b" (LOC="AB16") are reversed and can not
   be placed without changing the functionality (polarity) of the signal. To
   correct this error, either modify the LOC values or change the buffer
   connections in the code so that the P-side of the differential buffer is
   LOCed to the pin location "AB16" and the N-side of the buffer is LOCed to the
   pin location "AB15".
   It is possible   to allow location constraints to override this rule by
   setting the environment variable XIL_PAR_ALLOW_LVDS_LOC_OVERRIDE.
