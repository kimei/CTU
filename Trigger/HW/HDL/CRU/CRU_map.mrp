Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    31 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  31
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         75 out of  19,200    1%
    Number used as logic:                       74 out of  19,200    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              59
      Number using O5 output only:              14
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        15 out of  38,400    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                15

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           75
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            44 out of      75   58%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      75    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          31 out of      75   41%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  19,200    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         7 out of     360    1%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              1
    IOB Master Pads:                             1
    IOB Slave Pads:                              1

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3
  Number of PLL_ADVs:                            1 out of       2   50%

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:910 - It appears that the specified pin locations for differential
   pair "mclk" (LOC="AB15") and "mclk_b" (LOC="AB16") are reversed and can not
   be placed without changing the functionality (polarity) of the signal. To
   correct this error, either modify the LOC values or change the buffer
   connections in the code so that the P-side of the differential buffer is
   LOCed to the pin location "AB16" and the N-side of the buffer is LOCed to the
   pin location "AB15".
   It is possible   to allow location constraints to override this rule by
   setting the environment variable XIL_PAR_ALLOW_LVDS_LOC_OVERRIDE.
ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven packing phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:856 - PLL_ADV Inst_PLL_ALL/PLL_ADV_INST CLKIN2 pin was disconnected
   because a constant 1 is driving the CLKINSEL pin.
INFO:MapLib:841 - Changing COMPENSATION attribute from SYSTEM_SYNCHRONOUS to
   INTERNAL for PLL_ADV Inst_PLL_ALL/PLL_ADV_INST.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
