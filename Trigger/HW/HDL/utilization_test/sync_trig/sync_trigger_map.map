Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    72 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  72
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         46 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       46 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              40
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                    5

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    33 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          104
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            32 out of     104   30%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  58 out of     104   55%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          14 out of     104   13%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  28,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        47 out of     480    9%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        1 out of      47    2%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.52

Peak Memory Usage:  644 MB
