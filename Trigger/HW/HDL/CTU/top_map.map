Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    31 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  31
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         75 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       74 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              59
      Number using O5 output only:              14
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        15 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                15

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    26 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           75
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            44 out of      75   58%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      75    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          31 out of      75   41%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         5 out of     480    1%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              1
    IOB Master Pads:                             1
    IOB Slave Pads:                              1

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2
  Number of PLL_ADVs:                            1 out of       6   16%
